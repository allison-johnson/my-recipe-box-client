[x] Style a recipe card (maybe use back for notes?)

[x] Categories 
    - store category_id in store
    - when dropdown menu is changed, dispatch action to store that will change category_it
    - when recipesContainer is rendered, only render recipes whose category_id matches the state's

[x] Fix category_id functionality in RecipeForm
    [x] add more categories
    [] add 'category' label to UI (?)

[] New recipe form should only render when button is clicked

[] Turn recipeCard into a "stateless, functional" component?

[] Add React routes

[] Add component for notes (rendered by RecipeCard, similar to restaurant lab)
    [x] Load notes
    [] Add a new note
    [] Maybe notes are on the back of a card?

Questions
1. How can I make headers bold? font-weight in CSS doesn't appear to do anything.
